      <description> I thought it would be interesting to publish a list of 5 things that I found interesting or liked during the week. I may publish these weekly or wait until I have 5 things to list. I may go back and add context.

      <description>“They tell you the first rule is not to die don’t they?”
“I beg your pardon?”
“When you’re signing the release papers they always tell you that the first rule is not to die because then you can’t go back. I just assumed they told you the same thing.”

      <description>When was the last time you took a selfie or posted a status update? For many of us it was no longer than a few hours ago. Today’s technological world revolves around social media and excessive sharing. Our society celebrates uniqueness and individualism but we are never allowed the time to appreciate and explore our own identities without social context. We are constantly broadcasting ourselves to our friends and to the world without ever understanding the impact it has on us.</description>

      <description>Note: I began writing this piece several months ago but never got around to finishing it. Some of the news is old, but the idea is still the same.
Several weeks ago I quit Facebook. I know, way to get on the bandwagon, but I really just found that I was not gaining anything from the service, especially the News Feed. However, I was pretty reliant on the messaging component of Facebook, mainly for my friends outside of the U.</description>

I'm a front-end engineer currently working at Garmin on [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com "Garmin Connect").

I use Backbone and React to make visualizations for fitness data.

I like playing basketball, I'm an avid Clemson football fan, and I'm currently working on my Master's at Georgia Tech.

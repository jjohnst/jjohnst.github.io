      <description> I thought it would be interesting to publish a list of 5 things that I found interesting or liked during the week. I may publish these weekly or wait until I have 5 things to list. I may go back and add context.

      <description>When was the last time you took a selfie or posted a status update? For many of us it was no longer than a few hours ago.

      <description>Note: I began writing this piece several months ago but never got around to finishing it. Some of the news is old, but the idea is still the same.
